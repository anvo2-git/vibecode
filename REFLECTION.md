# Assignment 3 Reflection, The Common Nose, Electric Boogaloo

## 1. What did you build, and what does it do?

I took my perfume recommendation web app (in assignment 2) and attached a database to it to store user favourites. Also I really really wanted to have a relevant API to pull related to perfumes (technically I implemented a perfume search -> if doesnt exist in database then scrape Fragrantica, but I didn't know if that would have counted as API), so I... did a little GPS  +  weather -> recced perfume vibe thing.  The app lets you discover new fragrances through FOUR! paths:
- searching a catalog of 68,000 perfumes (or more on Fragrantica!!!) and picking up to 3 seeds for similarity-based recommendations
- building a scent profile by selecting leading and trailing accords
- taking a 5-question quiz that maps preferences to accord families.
- weather + GPS based path.

The recommendation engine works by representing each perfume as a vector of accord weights and ranking candidates by cosine similarity to the user's seed perfumes. A Dirichlet refinement layer sits on top and alters those rankings as users vote thumbs-up or thumbs-down on recommendations. Authenticated users (via Clerk + Supabase) can save favorites that persist across sessions. A "Today's Scent" page uses the browser's geolocation API with an Open-Meteo weather proxy to suggest accords appropriate for current conditions.

## 2. What was the hardest technical challenge, and how did you solve it?

The hardest challenge was a cascade of broken native binaries caused by a disk-full event on WSL2 (my Claude kept shitting itself and exiting the terminal and that got me real STRESSED but I ignored her. Then WSL started giving me CORE DUMP warnings ((????!))). But it's all ok now. The symptoms looked like a Node.js or Next.js bug. The build worker was crashing with SIGBUS (bus error / memory-mapped file fault) — but the real cause was that three Rust-compiled `.node` addons (`@tailwindcss/oxide`, `lightningcss`, `@unrs/resolver-binding`) had been silently corrupted when the filesystem ran out of space mid-write. The error message gave no indication of which binary was at fault.

Ian's note: Claude tried to fix this for a VERY long time, and discouraged me from continue fixing it for awhile (since the Vercel version built) - it yapped to me a lot about CI/CD instead of local building. I had to give Claude context that 'hey my WSL just shat itself due to a core dump' for it to be able to fix it. So lesson learn is don't just 'Claude fix my mess' - you gotta help her out.

The solution was to isolate each native addon individually with a minimal `require()` test, identify which ones crashed with SIGBUS, re-download fresh tarballs from the npm registry, and overwrite the corrupted binaries. Additionally, `@supabase/supabase-js` ships empty `.d.mts` TypeScript declaration files (a known packaging quirk), which caused a separate type-checking failure; those were fixed by writing re-export stubs pointing at the `.d.cts` equivalents, now automated in a `postinstall` script.

Ian: I love that for you Claude, or sorry that happened.

## 3. What would you do differently or add with more time?

With more time I would replace the static big ass JSON bundle (14 MB served on first load) with a Supabase-backed search endpoint that queries a proper full-text index. The current approach works but forces the client to download the entire catalog before any search can run. I would also wire the frontend to the existing `perfume_notes` Supabase table so personal notes persist across sessions (the schema exists but is not yet connected to the UI), and add aggregated community favorites per perfume. I would also fix it so the Search function is more responsive. Right now it freezes whenever you type in a letter. Also, images of the bottles would be nice. But considering there's no API available this would be hard/impossible :/


## 4. What did you learn about building with external APIs and authentication?

Claude:
The main lesson is that the integration layer between two auth systems is where complexity hides. Clerk handles identity and issues JWTs; Supabase uses those JWTs to enforce row-level security via `auth.jwt() ->> 'sub'`. Getting that chain right required configuring Third-Party Auth in the Supabase dashboard, writing RLS policies, and passing the Clerk session token as Supabase's `accessToken` on every request. None of that is difficult once you understand the model, but the failure mode — silently blocked database writes with no visible error to the user — is hard to debug without logging.

The broader lesson is that multi-vendor stacks (Next.js + Clerk + Supabase + Open-Meteo + Wikipedia) introduce a lot of surface area where packaging bugs, empty distribution files, and mismatched key formats can combine to produce failures that look unrelated to their actual cause. Defensive tooling — the `patch-esm.js` postinstall script and individual binary smoke tests — paid off more than expected.

Ian:
Honestly, not... a whole not in the beginning? And also near the end. I fed Claude Andre's slides, and Claude followed it, and whenever Claude needed anythnig from me I just followed her instructions. And then things kinda just worked out. I took it upon myself to kind of google/youtube/etc etc things to get an understanding and un-blackbox the process, but that's entirely orthogonal to having a functional simple auth + backend system vibecoded by Claude. I reckon that the more you know what's going on the easier it would be for you to help Claude unfuck itself (because some of the errors took her quite awhile).
